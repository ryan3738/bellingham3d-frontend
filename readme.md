# Site Features

## Server Side Rendering with Next.js

This project uses server side rendering so that products and inventory can be up to date. On the server, the application grabs the data it needs and renders the html to the client. The application interacts with Apolloâ€™s cache and awaits results from the database.

### Main product and home page

## User cart

As the user adds items it will be added to their cart and displayed in the cart modal.

## Integration with Stripe API for Customer Checkout

If items require shipping address create/update options are displayed. Once an address is selected the stripe checkout is displayed. To ensure a secure checkout, the final checkout mutation is handled on the server.
